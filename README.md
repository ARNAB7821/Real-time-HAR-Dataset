**Data Collection Tools:**
           All the volunteers used their own smartphones for collecting data. The configuration of all the smartphones is different, and each contains the Android operating system.
           Due to the variation in hardware components and different smartphone brands, the collected data may vary slightly. Each smartphone contains the software G-sensor Logger for 
           collecting activities data. 

**G-sensor Logger:** 
           It captures accelerometer (G-sensor) data and logs it to CSV files, calculates magnitude, minimum & maximum values, and offers playback of recorded data.
           Sudden changes in motion can be detected and recorded using the G-sensor.
